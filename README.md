This add-on provides the ability to collect information on a FileMaker screen and send the data to other services. With a few button presses (or calls from other scripts), the user can send data to a given destination or service. Users can post information from various layouts in FileMaker to a common receptionist.

You may be thinking, "Why don't I just use FileMaker to build all my workflows without using other services? However, if you have been using communication tools for a long time, you may find it easier to use a familiar tool to accept applications and run the workflow in your backyard. What used to be a Word, Excel, or PDF file application can now be entered into the FileMaker layout, click on the application button, and it will flow to the receptionist, where the staff can click on the link to FileMaker and check the contents.

The three communication tools we targeted this time were Redmine, Slack, and eMail (Gmail). We created add-ons for each of these services. The add-on works like a hub between FileMaker and the communication tools. In the Slack and eMail versions, the information goes in one direction, from the applicant to the receptionist, but in the Redmine version, the status of the ticket (issue) can be checked in FileMaker. This is just one example. This is just one example, but you can use this add-on as a template and customize it to suit various services.

The basic image of this workflow is that of a general receptionist or inquiry handling workflow, such as various application windows for an organization or group, user inquiry management, sales reporting, and incident handling. This type of system is no longer uncommon with web services, but FileMaker has the advantage that everything can function on-premise. For example, the system can be used to set up an urgent response desk at an emergency headquarters, or a contact point for needs, issues, and requests at an evacuation center, or any other urgent system that is not connected to the Internet. You can quickly create input forms for various needs in FileMaker, paste in this add-on, and you have an instant reception system.
